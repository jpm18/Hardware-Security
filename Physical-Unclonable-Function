Physical Unclonable Function circuits are important security primitives to effectively solve the security problems connected with hardware security like counterfeiting 
and authentication applications in IoT systems. Different topologies of PUF are presented in the past and still researchers are interested in investigating the novel PUF
topologies with better metrics and associated CRP processing circuits for intended applications

 The aim of this project is to design PUF based hardware security schemes to be used for authenticating device to device interactions. Physically Un-clonable Functions
(PUFs) are widely used in hardware security implementations as they physically define the digital footprint of the device. PUFs provide a unique identifier for the 
hardware which could be leveraged for various purposes
